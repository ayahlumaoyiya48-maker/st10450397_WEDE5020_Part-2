index.html
The homepage HTML was cleaned up to make it simpler and easier to read. The wrong <!DOCTYPE> declaration was fixed, and the navigation menu was organized better by putting each link in a list item, which solved a big HTML validation problem. I took out a nested <header> tag from the main content to keep things clear, and moved the <footer> to the correct spot outside the section. A typo in the title "Appparel" was corrected to "Apparel," and we optimized the main image with loading="lazy" for faster performance. These changes make the site better for users on both desktop and mobile devices. I also put the appropriate html to their right pages.

The services page HTML has been updated for better clarity and accessibility. The navigation menu now has anchor tags properly placed within list items , ensuring valid structure and layout consistency. A stray character  was removed after the navigation section to avoid rendering problems. An empty heading tag was detected and should be either deleted or filled with relevant content to boost SEO. The <section id="services"> was also improved for readability and spacing between text and product cards. The product gallery uses valid HTML, but make sure all product items are properly closed with </div>. The footer is correctly positioned outside the main content, and the overall cleanup enhances readability, structure, and maintainability. 

The About Us page has been updated for better structure according to HTML standards and to improve how it displays on different browsers. I fixed the main navigation by placing anchor tags inside list items for proper formatting. I also noticed a missing "<" at the start of the head tag, which needs to be corrected to "<head>" so the head section works properly. There was an empty <h1> in the header that should either have content for SEO or be removed to keep things tidy. The content in the about section is good, but I can improve spacing and make images more responsive. The footer is correctly placed outside the main content area. These changes will help keep the HTML clean and ensure it looks good across all devices.

The Contact page was reviewed and cleaned up for HTML validity and layout consistency. A critical error was found with a stray paragraph tag placed before any actual paragraph — this was removed to avoid layout issues. As with other pages, the navigation bar had anchor tags directly placed inside a list without wrapping them in elements, which violates standard HTML structure, so i corrected it. The heading tag inside the header was left empty and should either be populated for SEO or removed if unused. The contact information section is clearly structured, and semantic elements like email and phone links were correctly implemented using mailto: and tel: schemes. Social media icons were included via Ionicons, and the necessary scripts were placed in the footer. The page layout is functional but benefits from improved HTML structure and responsive styling in CSS.

The HTML for the Enquiries page was checked for clarity and structure. Like the other pages, there’s an issue with the navigation section because the anchor  tags aren't inside list items in the. This needs to be fixed for better formatting and accessibility. The <h1> in the header is empty; it should either have the page title or be removed to keep the markup tidy. The enquiry form is set up well, with proper <label> elements linked to each form control using the for attribute, and it has important HTML5 validation with the required attribute. The form also uses div blocks and the right input types (text, email, textarea), which makes it more user-friendly and accessible. The footer is in the right spot and shows the standard copyright information.

I added a Map page that has been reviewed and cleaned up to make sure it’s structured correctly and follows embedding standards. The main problem found was that anchor tags were placed directly inside the element in the navigation bar without being wrapped in tags, which needs to be fixed for valid HTML. The map itself is set up well, using an iframe with the right attributes like allowfullscreen, loading="lazy", and referrerpolicy, which help with performance and security. The map is inside a responsive .map-container div, but I'll need some extra CSS to make sure it looks good on mobile devices. The footer is placed correctly on the page but is inside the map section, which should be closed before the footer starts. Once I make these adjustments, the page will be valid, accessible, and good to go for launch.

CSS

The stylesheet was improved to create a clean and modern look for the Slime Season Apparel website. A reset using the * selector helps maintain consistency in different browsers. The navigation bar features a bright lime green background with white hover effects, matching the brand’s bold style. Each main section — including Home, Services, About Us, Contact, and Footer — is designed for easy reading and visual attractiveness. We used Flexbox for the layout of the navigation and product gallery, making cards pop up when hovered over. The About Us section was designed with mobile users in mind and later adjusted with media queries for a split layout on larger screens. We ensured the site is responsive with specific breakpoints for small (phones), medium (tablets), and large (desktops/laptops) screens. Buttons, forms, and interactive elements like social icons are styled with smooth transitions and hover effects to enhance user experience. Additional touches include focused states for forms, responsive icons, and consistent typography throughout the site.
